# Civil Service Acronym Buster (Teams-App)

This is my first attempt of developing a teams app and stepping into the world of M365. The ambition is for a User to message a bot, the bot query a database and then returns any matches to the user with it's definition

Strech Goal - Allow users to submit new ones staight from the app
